Diffusion Coefficient Calculator with Jupyter Widgets 
Description 
This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based application that calculates the diffusion coefficient DAB​for a binary mixture ( methanol-water) using a mathematical model. The application uses ipywidgets to create an interactive interface where users can input mole fractions ( xa A​and xb​) and compute the diffusion coefficient. It also compares the calculated value with a reference experimental value to determine the relative error.
Features Interactive interface: Built with ipywidgets for easy input and output.
Real-time calculation: Computes the diffusion coefficient and error instantly.
Scientific output: Displays results in scientific notation for precision.
Technologies Used Python: The core programming language.
Jupyter Notebook: For creating an interactive environment.
ipywidgets: For building the user interface.
NumPy: For mathematical computations.
